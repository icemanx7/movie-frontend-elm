# Front end for Movie Database

## Intro

So I wrote a database server in Scala that servers up Movies in forms of JSON format. I wrote a front in in react to parse it and generate the table and front end with it. I recently adopted Haskell as my main langauge so I want to write in a front end language similar to Haskell or at least with a type system. So I decided to rewrite the frontend in Elm and as an exercise to learn elm.

## How to run

So now its pretty simple. You can just run ```elm-make``` to generate the HTML and then open the ```index.html``` in your browser.

## TODO

* Full Front end
* Login
* JSON parsing
* Web server with live reloading
